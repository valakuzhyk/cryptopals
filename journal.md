#Cryptopals journey

Here I will be keeping track of all of my notes, starting from challenge 2 and beyond. I had already done Challenge 1 (in python), so I was not really interested in journaling my journey through that. However, from this point forward, I think it would be a good habit to get into.

## Set 1
### Challenges 1-8
Late to the game...


## Set 2
### Challenge 9: Implement PKCS#7 padding
